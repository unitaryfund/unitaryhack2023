TorchQuantum is a library for classical simulation of quantum circuit and training of variational quantum circuits. It has several features:

- Easy construction and simulation of quantum circuits in PyTorch
- Dynamic computation graph for easy debugging
- Gradient support via autograd
- Batch mode inference and training on CPU/GPU
- Easy deployment on real quantum devices such as IBMQ
- Easy hybrid classical-quantum model construction
- Pulse-level simulation
