## ðŸš€ Website development

Want to help improve the unitaryHACK website?
The website is built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and hosted on GitHub Pages.
The [Fernfolio](https://fernfolio.netlify.app/) template was used to bootstrap the design.
Here are some basic local setup steps to get you started:

### Local environment

- Clone the repo
- Navigate to the directory `cd untitaryhack`
- Install the goods `npm install`
- Run it `npm start`
- You should now be able to see everything running on http://localhost:8080
- Make a pull request to add your changes to github

## ðŸ’» Development Scripts

**`npm start`**: Run 11ty with hot reload at localhost:8080

**`npm run build`**: Generate minified production build

Check out the Eleventy [command line usage docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/usage/) for more options.
