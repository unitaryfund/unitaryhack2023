### Q. When is the hackathon, and is there a registration deadline?

The hackathon will run from May 26-Jun 13, and you can register at any point before the event is over.

### Q. Does it cost anything?

Nope, but YOU can get paid if you work on an issue with a bounty and your contribution is selected by the project maintainers!
See the list of [participating projects]({{ '/projects/' | url }}) to see the bountied issues for each repo.

### Q. How does the hackathon work?

**tl;dr**: Make an approved contribution to a [participating open source project]({{ '/projects/' | url }}) between May 16-Jun 13 and you will win SWAG. If your contribution to a bountied issue is deemed the satisfactory solution by the maintainers of the project, we will send you cash via PayPal.

### Q. Can I work on a team? If I want a team, how can I find one?

Absolutely!
You are free to work on teams, just make sure that everyone's username is mentioned in the pull request!
Please note that the bounties are awarded per solution/pull request and it is up to the team to split the money.

Contributors with any skill level can participate in unitaryhack. We have worked with maintainers to make sure there are issues available for all levels of experience, both for quantum-related as well as simply open-source-related contributions.
If you are having trouble finding issues you want to work on, be sure to ask on the [Discord](http://discord.unitary.fund) and the organizing team can brainstorm with you.
